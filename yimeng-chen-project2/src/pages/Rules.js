            <h3>How to Play Battleships</h3>
            <p>
              Battleship is a game of guessing, strategy and logical thought. Each playerâ€™s fleet includes 5 ships of different sizes (5, 4, 3, 3, and 2 squares). Ships are placed randomly on a 10x10 board.
            </p>
            <h3>Game Play</h3>
            <p>
              The player goes first by clicking on the enemy board. A hit or miss is marked, then the AI takes its turn choosing an unselected cell on your board. In Normal mode, turns alternate.
            </p>
            <h3>Victory</h3>
            <p>
              When one player has all their enemy ships sunk, the game is over and that player is declared the winner.
            </p>
            <h3>Variations</h3>
            <p>
              Two modes are provided: Normal (turn-based with AI moves) and Free Play (only the enemy board is shown; no AI turns).
